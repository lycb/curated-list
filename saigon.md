# Ho Chi Minh city/Saigon Recommendations 

(Last updated May 2, 2024)

This list is curated by me and my sister (who lives in HCMC permanently). I visit once a year and changes this list whenever I go. 

> [!IMPORTANT]

### Book flights ✈️

> [!NOTE]
> This section only contains tips for flying from the United States only.

- I usually use [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) and [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/#) to look at tickets
- Typical price point for tickets from smaller cities on the East Coast are around $1200-2500 per person round trip in Economy
- Book with at least 2 hours overlay, 2.5 hours overlay is usually the sweet spot (if you book < 2 hours, you have about a high chance of having to run to reach the gate on time)

### Booking a hotel 🏨
This is a map of Saigon by district. 

> [!NOTE]
> As of 2021, districts 2, 9, and Thu Duc are now considered Thu Duc city (part of HCMC). However, for the purpose of this doc, I will prefer to them as their respective districts.

### Hotel recommendations
- Mai House Saigon Hotel (5-star hotel)
- Park Hyatt Saigon (5-star hotel)
- Sheraton Saigon Hotel & Towers (5-star hotel)
- Adora Art Hotel (4-star hotel)
- The Bloom Pham Viet Chanh (3-star hotel)
- COMMON INN Thao Dien (3-star hotel)

### Airbnb location recommendations
- **Districts 1 & 3**: Plenty of places to visit during the day. Night life is great with lots of bars, restaurants within walking distance. 
- **District 2** (aka  Thảo Điền): Lots of foreign restaurants, more English speakers/staffs.
- **District Binh Thanh**: Easily access district 1, 2, 3 with cheaper prices. I'd recommend looking for Airbnb inside of [Vinhomes Central Park](https://vinhomes.vn/en)

### Applying for the visa ✈️📄
[Link to visa application](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/khai-thi-thuc-dien-tu/cap-thi-thuc-dien-tu)

**Notes**:
- For `Intended temporary residential address in Vietnam`, put the address of the first hotel/Airbnb you booked
- For `Purpose of entry`, put "Tourism"
- For `Religion`, I'm not exactly sure why Vietnam requires this field but you're safe to simply put “None” if you feel uncomfortable providing it.

> [!WARNING]
> This type of visa is only good for 30 days, so do not book your flight for longer than 30 days. Unless you plan on exiting the country and come back with a new visa.
### Communications 📱
It is **strongly recommended** to get a SIM card for data usage. Here are some options:
- [Get a prepaid SIM card in Vietnam](https://wanderingwheatleys.com/best-vietnam-sim-card-tourist-prepaid-mobile-internet/) (only for unlocked phones)
- Talk to your service provider about using their plan internationally
- [e-SIM in Vietnam](https://vietnamdiscovery.com/vietnam-esim/) for people with Iphone 14+

### Apps for transportation needs 🚙📱
- [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/)
- [Xanh SM](https://www.xanhsm.com/en/)

### Medical Preparations 🫀

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your body is not used to the cultural bacteria in Vietnam, it is strongly recommended that you take a probiotic packet daily to prevent stomach aches and diarrhea. If you run out, you can easily get more at local pharmacies.
>
> _Disclaimer_: I am **NOT** a doctor, this is just what works for me and my family in the past. There is a chance that you won't get travelers diarrhea even without probiotic but are you willing to take that chance? 

- Get travel insurance
- Tell your doctor about your plans for travel and ask for any recommendation
- Ask your doctor about available vaccinations
- Bring your prescriptions 
- Prepare over the counter meds like Tylenol, Gas-X, etc.
- [CDC guidelines to travel to Vietnam](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/vietnam)
- Get probiotics (can get more in Vietnam)

## Arriving at HCMC 🛬

## Traveling within HCMC
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take a picture of your passport to avoid risk of pickpocketing.
> 
> Always keep your valuables in front of you, not behind where pickpocketing can happen easily

### Weather ☀️☀️☀️☀️🌧

### Tap water 🚰
Drinking tap water is **NOT** safe. This [link](https://backofthebiketours.com/can-i-drink-water-in-vietnam/) sums it up pretty well, please read carefully as it contains important health information

### Currency 💰
Vietnam uses the VND currency (Vietnam Đồng). No, đồng (dong) is not poop, it means “coin”. And yes, my husband had already made the joke 💩🤦

Currently, $1 USD is about 24,770 VND. But that’s really hard to remember right? The best way to convert money in your head is to round down to 20,000 VND to determine if the item you are purchasing is expensive or not.  

For example: 500,000 VND is about $25 USD because 500,000 VND / 20,000 VND = $25 USD 

#### Cash or card? 💳
Every place accepts cash, but you can use card sometimes for transportations, malls, stores, etc. There might be a fee depending on your bank.

### Transportation 🚙

#### Grab or Xanh SM
[Grab or Xanh SM](#apps-for-transportation-needs) is _strongly reommended_ to be your main mode of transportation. You can book a car or a scooter from your phone and pay with cash or card when you arrive at your destination. The total amount will appear before you book your ride so you can prepare the cash beforehand. 

#### Rent a scooter
If you wish to ride a scooter, you can rent one. We have had good experiences renting from [VietRide](https://vietride.vn/). 

> [!WARNING]
> Obviously, this is illegal as you do not have a license (International Driving Permit does not work in Vietnam). Riding scooters in HCMC is also really dangerous because it is very busy and the traffic flow is confusing. Please drive safe and be careful. 

#### Taxis
You can also flag any taxis down by waving your hand (you will know if a taxi is available if the light on top of the taxi is lit). Taxis can be scammy, they might try to hack the clock to make you pay more. That’s why Grab is a recommended mode of transportation since you know the price before you go. That being said, here are some taxis branch I trust more than others:
- Mai Linh
- Vinasun
- Xanh SM
